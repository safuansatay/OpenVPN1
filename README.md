openvpn-install

OpenVPN road warrior installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

Fork

This fork includes :

No logs
No comp-lzo compression is a vector for oracle attacks, e.g. CRIME or BREACH
Better encryption (see below)
Avoid DNS leak
UFW support
TLS 1.2 only
Strong ciphers, DH keys and certificates. (see variants)
AES-256-CBC and SHA-512 for HMAC (instead of BF-128-CBC and SHA1)
Run server in unprivileged mode, reducing risks to the system

Variants

When you lauch the script you will be asked to choose a mode. Both will work the same way, but slow has higher encryption settings, so it may slow down your connection and take more time to install.

If you're just using your VPN at home, you may choose "fast". But if you're often using public Wi-Fi or traveling a lot, you choose use slow.

FYI, "fast" is still more secured than default OpenVPN settings.

Slow (high encryption)

Features :

4096 bits RSA private key

Fast (lower encryption)

Features :
